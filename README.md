# Interactive Learning Tool

## Introduction

The Interactive Learning Tool, developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, leverages several key technologies and concepts to enhance its functionality and user experience. The application's structure, built around OOP, uses various classes to manage user interactions, question handling, and data management. It is developed as a part of the [Turing College Web Development Program](https://www.turingcollege.com/web-development).

## Key Features

- **Question Modes:** Add, view, disable/enable both quiz and free-form text questions.
- **Practice Mode:** Adaptive learning based on user's past responses.
- **Test Mode:** Randomized assessments to gauge user knowledge.
- **User Profiles:** Manage multiple user profiles with individual stats.
- **Statistics Tracking:** In-depth tracking of question performance and usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Primary programming language, using OOP principles.
- **File I/O:** For persistent data storage of questions and user profiles.
- **Regular Expressions:** Utilized in various functionalities for data processing.
- **Unit Testing:** Ensures reliability and correctness of the application.

## Usage

Run the application:

```sh
python src/main.py
```
